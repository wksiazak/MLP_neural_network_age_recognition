Main purpose of this project was to trained MLP model based on available training dataset which could predict age of people in photos in testing dataset. 
Project consists of few steps which are: 
* spliting training dataset on training and validation one 
* creating generator in seperate class which improves training model based on images 
* building and training model
* evaluating model
